# My Teaching Career in NUS

## My Teaching Experiences

Looking throughout my teaching journey in NUS, I have been part-time
teaching in the School of Computing (SoC) for 2.5 years. 

I have taught the following modules in NUS: 

- CS1101S Programming Methodology
- CS2030/S Programming Methodology II
- CS2102 Database Systems 

## Common Misconceptions 

1. Prior to contrary belief, you do not need a super-duper grade to teach 
in SoC. I have scored an average of A- for the 3 above modules. 

2. You do not need to be a know-it-all kind of person. It is okay to not 
know how to answer certain questions during class. However, you should take
the responsibility to get back to them on these unanswered questions that 
you are not sure of. 

3. **DO NOT SPOONFEED**. By providing answers, it doesn't really prove that
your students will understand. Go through the thought process and, explain
in layman terms if needed. 

## How I deal with Online Classes

During the past few semesters, most lessons had to be mounted online
via Zoom due to the COVID-19 Situation. As a result, things must be 
done different.

1. I usually do not force people to turn on their cameras despite there being 
class participation. This is because tutorial lessons are meant to be a safe 
space for interaction and I do my best to try to keep things as comfortable 
as possible. 
2. Using Zoom Annotations. One good thing that I found while student was 
presenting was to use Annotations to **direct the attention** of students
to the important parts which were needed.

## Dealing with Classes in General

1. Recap the content beforehand. Usually, it would be good to tie in the 
learning objectives from the previous lecture with the current tutorial / lab 
lesson such that it becomes more relatable, and at the same time, help to 
clarify questions before the tutorial or lab.  
2. Being approachable is **super important** as it helps with interacting with 
your students. Turn on your camera even though your students might not. 
Try to get to know each other before the class starts, do some chit-chat and 
understand if they have any issues with the lessons thus far. This brings me 
to my next point.
3. Staying contactable. By this, I **DO NOT** mean being online for your students
24/7. After all, you are a student as well and must manage your own modules. 
What I mean by this is to create a chat group so that the tutorial group can 
ask and discuss about queries about the module. Not only do you have the chance 
to understand the areas in which some of your students might be struggling in, 
but also give another avenue for interaction to take place. 

## The Good

Well, there were plenty of great feedback from my students from the past few 
years. I would like to point out some of these comments to elaborate on the 
points which I have mentioned earlier. 

![Feedback-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327217-fadf9ef2-d384-4d02-bb2d-c77df10967e0.png)

As I mentioned, one important factor is <b>to be approachable.</b> If you 
are willing and able to listen, naturally, you would be able to build somewhat good
camaraderie with your students. 

![Feedback-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327224-7385a13d-c625-49f3-b0a3-ae46799ed64f.png)

As mentioned, do take the opportunity to talk with your students and get to know 
them. Do your best to ensure that your students take something away from the lesson 
and if not, do approach them if needed. After all, your students are the spotlight 
for your teaching stint. 

## The Not-So-Good

Mainly it has to do with speaking speed. It will be good to stand in front of a mirror
and observe how you speak and present. Unfortunately, I usually tend to speak too fast 
which is a downside. 

## Teaching Feedback

Over the past 5 semesters, I have generally received positive feedback. What I want to say
is that if you put in the effort to understand your students and establish good 
camaraderie with your students, you can make a good impact on them and, make new friends
along the way as well. 

## Concluding Thoughts

For those that wish to apply as a teaching assistant in SoC, do know that it is not going to 
be an easy journey as it can be a time-sink. Do more than the minimum, and you'll
be amazed at the impact that you can leave on your students. 

Thank you for reading and have a great day!
