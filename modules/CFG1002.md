## Brief Overview

This module is a 2MC module which will be completed in 6 weeks.

Basically it prepares you for internship interviews and how you can connect and communicate with people at your workplace or your internship.

A pretty useful module if you take it seriously. It is mostly hands-on so you can definitely talk and interact with the people around you. As a result, you can be sure to meet a new friend or two in this module!

I would strongly recommend to take this module one semester before your internship applicatio
