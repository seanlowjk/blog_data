## Brief Overview

Warning! Be prepared to put a lot of effort for this module, especially during the second half of the semester.

This module is an introductory module to to computational thinking and fundamentals which will be really important in future modules in NUS CS. Just because this module has an S/U Option DOES NOT MEAN you should treat this module lightly.

## Workload 

11/10

If you are not familiar with the concepts taught in 1101S, you will definitely need to put in more effort than those who have strong background in computational thinking and processes.

## Difficulty 

10/10

This is not a module I breezed through. I definitely had issues in the first half of the semester understanding wishful thinking and not hard cording through every mission I go through.

## Grade
