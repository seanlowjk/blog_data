## Brief Overview

If you have a strong musical background, this module is not difficult to score. However, do not underestimate the tests given in GEH1030. The computational questions can be quite tricky.

Overall, I feel that this module is great for those who are really interested to learn more about music and the fundamentals of physics behind musics. There is quite a lot of self-exploration you can do via the MIDI Music Composition. Not only that, you also are to write an essay on a concert you have attended!

I feel that if you want to have a quick start on how music works, this is the module for you! If and only if you do not mind the super steep bell curve, as there are plenty of students who will do well for the Term Tests.

## Workload 

6/10

Attending Tutorials and Lectures are Good Enough. The Essay should take you around 1 day and the Music Composition should take you around 2 to 3 days, Do practice your tutorials as they might appear again in your tests!

## Difficulty 

6/10

Not easy to score, but not easy to fail either. Be careful of the steep bell curve in this module.
