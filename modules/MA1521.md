## Brief Overview

A-Level Mathematics Students may find this module easier to cope with. On the other hand, those who did not take A-Level Mathematics might struggle. It's really all calculations. No proving is required of this module.

As a result, this module has a really steep bell curve, as most students score full marks for the Online Quiz. As a result, you grade truly depends on how well you perform for finals. Keep doing your tutorials and you should be fine. Do remember to attempt past year papers to expect what kind of calculations and concepts you need to grasp.

Good to take this module 1 semester before ST2334, as ST2334 requires a lot of calculus.
